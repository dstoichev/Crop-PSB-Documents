# Crop-PSB-Documents
A series of files is OPEN in Photoshop.
All the files are (often) 16 bit, they are huge layered files with a layer in the file called CROP.
We need the images saved cropped via the CROP layer.
We need the result file to take the file name of the document.

# Installation:
 1. Place "Crop Saver.jsx" in <Photoshop Directory>/presets/scripts/

 2. Restart Photoshop

 3. Select File -> Scripts -> Crop Saver

 Optional: Set a keyboard shortcut or record an action for faster access.
