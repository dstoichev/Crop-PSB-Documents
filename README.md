# Crop-PSB-Documents
A series of files is OPEN in Photoshop.
All the files are (often) 16 bit, they are huge layered files with a layer in the file called CROP.
We need the images saved cropped via the CROP layer when this layer exists and the image AS IS when the layer is absent.
We need the result file to take the file name of the document.
